Respondents who frequently used [English at their job](#language-usage) had a higher average job satisfaction. It's possible that this correlation was the result of the higher salaries that are associated with English usage.

We didn't notice a strong correlation between a respondent's [language ability](#language-ability) and job satisfaction, beyond those who didn't speak any Japanese having a slightly lower job satisfaction.
