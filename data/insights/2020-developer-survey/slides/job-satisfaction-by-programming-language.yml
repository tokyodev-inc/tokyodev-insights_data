With the exception of a few outliers, programming languages didn't strongly correlate with job satisfaction. As respondents who used PHP also had the [lowest salaries](#salary-by-programming-language), this could in part explain their low satisfaction. On the other hand, neither Swift nor Objective-C correlated with exceptionally high salaries, indicating that there is more to this correlation than it just being a proxy for salary.
