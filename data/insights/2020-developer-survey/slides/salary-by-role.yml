Engineering managers stood out as being considerably better compensated than other [roles](#role). Part of this was because they tended to be more [experienced](#experience), with an average of 11.7 years as opposed to 8.3 years for non-managers.

However, as *Developer, game or graphics*, the role with the lowest compensation, also had above average experience at 9.4 years, it's not only experience influencing salary.
