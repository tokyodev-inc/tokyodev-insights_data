title: Residency status
question: What is your residency status in Japan?
---
Compared to [last year's survey](/insights/2020-developer-survey/#residency-status), the respondents that were permanent residents increased from 15 to 20%. This is perhaps explained by the border being virtually closed to new residents during 2021. Only [2,356 people](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/dbview?sid=0003423694) entered Japan on the Engineer / Specialist in Humanities /International Services visa status between January and October 2021, compared to [43,880 people](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/dbview?sid=0003288049) in the year of 2019.
