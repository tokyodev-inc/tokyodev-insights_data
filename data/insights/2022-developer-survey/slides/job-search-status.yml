question: Are you currently searching for a new job?
---
Respondents who were actively looking for a new job had a median salary of ¥6.5 million, whereas for those who weren't looking, it was ¥9.5 million. Part of the difference could be explained by those actively looking having a median of 5 years of professional experience, whereas those who weren't had 7 years.
