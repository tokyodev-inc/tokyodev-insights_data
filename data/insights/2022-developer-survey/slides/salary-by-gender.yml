Women tended to be less experienced than men, having a mean of 5 years experience compared to 8 years for men, partially explaining the difference in compensation. However, even when comparing the genders across similar experience levels, this gap in pay remained.

Men were also more likely then women to have a high paying role: while 21% of men had a role that was among the [top five highest paying](#salary-by-role), only 4% of women did.
