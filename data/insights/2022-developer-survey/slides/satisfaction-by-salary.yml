Respondents with a higher compensation scored themselves as being overall more satisfied with their job.

Unsurprisingly, the respondents satisfaction with their compensation was highly correlated with the compensation itself. While respondents with a compensation under 짜4 million had a median compensation satisfaction of 5, respondents earning over 짜16 million had a median of 9.

The weakest correlation was with colleague satisfaction, with even respondents making under 짜4 million per year having a median colleague satisfaction of 8.
